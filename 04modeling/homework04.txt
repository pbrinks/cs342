1.	Do exercise 14.31.
Consider the following relation for published books:

BOOK (Book_title, Author_name, Book_type, List_price, Author_affil, Publisher)

Book_title → Publisher, Book_type
Book_type → List_price
Author_name → Author_affil

a.	This relation is in 1NF because none of the fields allow for a list. This relation is not in BCNF because a candidate key is Book_title, Book_type, and Author_name, however, none of the functional dependencies have these three fields together on the left hand side. Since this relation is not in BCNF it is therefore not in 4NF.

b.	
* denotes primary key
** denotes foreign key

Book(ID*, title, publisher, typeID**, authorID**)
Type(ID*, name, list_price)
Author(ID*, name, affil)

The new functional dependencies are:
in Book:
ID -> title, publisher, typeID, authorID
in Type:
ID -> name, list_price
in Author:
ID -> name, affil

This is now in BCNF because all of the left hand sides are candidate keys and there are no fields in the tables that are not dependent on their candidate keys. I added the IDs to each table because Book_title, Author_name, and Book_type are not necessarily unique by themselves. These tables do not have any Multivalied dependencies and are therefore in 4NF.


2.	Do exercise 14.35. 
Consider the relation:

BOOK (Book_Name, Author, Edition, Year)

a.
Bookname and author are not unique enough to be a candidate key - need another field with them.
Possible candidate keys would be:
Book_Name, Author, Edition
Book_Name, Author, Copyright_Year

b.
For each book there must be several listings - one for each different author, then for each book and author, we need another record for each Edition and Copyright_Year. Therefore Book determines Author and also determines Edition, Year. Therefore for a book with two authors and two Editions it is necessary to have four rows in the table for just that one book.

c.
* denotes primary key
** denotes foreign key

Book (ID*, name, edition, year)
Author (ID*, name)
Book_Author(bookID**, authorID**)

Book:
ID -> name, edition, year
Author:
ID -> name
Book_Author:
no FDs

This is in BCNF, shown by the FDs above. This is also in 4NF because there are no longer any MVDs.
