option 1:

-- This table gives all of the attractions visited during a trip during the semester abraod
-- couse  CS 333. This query is useful because by switching out the dept, courseNumber and date, 
-- the professor leading the program can see which attractions they will be visiting during which trips
-- and what date they will be travelling

select ta.visit_date, a.name, t.location, a.timeLength, a.cost from Trip t, 
        Attraction a, TripAttraction ta, program p
where p.dept = 'CS'
and p.courseNumber = 333
and ta.visit_Date = '03-JUN-10'
and t.programID = p.ID
and ta.tripID = t.ID
and ta.attractionID = a.ID;



option 2:

-- This shows all the written reviews for semester abroad class IS 192 
-- this would be helpful for a student wanting to look up the reviews 
-- of a specific program they are interested in participating in
-- (could change the prog.dept and prog.courseNumber to look at any program)
select  part.firstName || ' ' || part.lastName as name,
        prog.dept || ' ' || prog.courseNumber as course,
		r.text
from Participant part, Program prog, Review r
where r.participantID = part.ID
and r.programID = prog.ID
and prog.dept = 'IS'
and prog.courseNumber = '192';
