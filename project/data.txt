I randomly generated my data using generatedata.com.


Functional Dependencies:
Department:
code -> fullName

Professor:
id -> firstName, lastName, dept

Program:
id -> dept, courseNumber, professorID, semester, country, city, cost, description, capacity

Participant:
id -> firsName, lastName, brithDate, major, grade

ProgramParticipant:
no nontrivial FDs

Review:
id -> participantID, programID, text, rating

Trip:
id -> name, location, timeLength, totalCost, description

Attraction:
id -> city, timeLength, cost

TripAttraction:
no nontrivial FDs

The functional dependencies above show that all fields in all tables are determined by a minimal candidate key. Therefore they are all in BCNF. Also, there are no multivalued dependencies, meaning this schema is also in 4NF.
