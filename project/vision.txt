For my project I would like to make a vacation or trip database. It would contain the following tables: Continent, Country, City, Attraction, Hotel, Restaurant, PublicTransport, and Trip. The stakeholders for my project would be someone planning a vacation, travel agencies, someone who wants to find more fun things to do in their own city, and any businesses contained in my databse (attractions, hotels, public transport, etc.). 

In order to make this more unique and have a more specific client base, I will be specifically be doing semester abroad programs offered by Calvin, specifying in the tables which semester (F, S, or I) the abroad program takes place in, along with specific attractions the students go to see in that semester, and also a rate field which displays how students who have taken this semester abroad before enjoyed it. With this my client base will be students interested in a particular semester abroad, professors who can get feedback on students experiences abroad, and students who have already taken the semester and can give feedback.

Based on my discussion with Professor Vander Linden, I have removed the ProgramParticipant table, and replaced all of its uses with the Review table. This is because the ProgramPartipant table only contained the foreign keys of programID and participantId, both of which are included in Review. Therefore it would be redundant to use both tables. I now use the Review table, to relate Participants to any Program they are enrolled in.
