steps for lost update concurrency problem:
script2

-- (step 1 - in script1) read from the Movie database 
		
-- (step 2) read from the Movie database 
	select * from Movie where id = 238071;
		-- rank starts at 8.5

-- (step 3 - in script1) update (subtract 0.1) the rank of Movie 238071		
		
-- (step 4) update (add 0.5) the rank Movie 238071
update Movie
set rank = (rank + 0.5)
where id = 238071;

-- the rank of this movie should now be 8.9, however, the update in script1 gets lost. This results in a new rank of 9.0.
