-- (step 1) read from the Movie database 
	select * from Movie where id = 238071;
	-- rank starts at 8.5

-- (step 2 - in script2) read from the Movie database 

-- (step 3) update (subtract 0.1) the rank of Movie 238071
		update Movie
		set rank = (rank - 0.1)
		where id = 238071;

-- (step 4 - in script2) update (add 0.5) the rank Movie 238071


Oracle automatically locks the tables when we are writing to them, so we are unable to run the update statement in script 2 until the update in script 1 has committed. When trying to run both updates at the same time, the second one will get "stuck" until the first update run is comitted. By adding a commit after each update, we are insuring that two updates do not happen at the same time and therefore are insuring that the property of isolation is kept.
